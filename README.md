# Valorant-Strat-Roulette
Valorant Strat Roulette Game ~
Make a program that generates random strategical plays(strats) depending on the:

Maps ~ Ascent, Icebox, Fracture, Pearl, Haven, Breeze, Bind
	
	2 sites = A & B
	3 sites = A, B, & C
	Ascent = 2 sites
	Icebox = 2 sites
	Fracture = 2 sites
	Pearl = 2 sites
	Breeze = 2 sites
	Bind = 2 sites
	
	Haven = 3 sites

Side ~ Different strats for:

	Attacker
	Defender

Strats ~ Depending on side and map:

2 sites = 
	
	strat_attack = ["rush B", "group attack A", "rush A", 
	"group attack B", "go mid", "play for picks", "play default"]
	strat_defense = ["play A", "play B", "watch mid", 
	"flank the enemy", "stack any site"]
	
3 sites = 
	
	strat_attack2 = ["rush C", "go garage into C", "peek mid window", "rush B", 
	"group attack A", "rush A", "group attack B", "go mid", "play for picks", "play default"]
	strat_defense2 = ["play A", "play B", "play C", "watch mid window and grass", 
	"flank the enemy", "stack any site", "rush to enemy spawn", "play garage"]
